🌿 Cashew Disease Detection App
A mobile application built with Flutter that empowers cashew farmers and agricultural stakeholders to quickly identify and treat issues affecting cashew crops. Using AI-powered image classification, the app detects whether a cashew tree is affected by a disease, insect, or abiotic stress, and provides diagnosis details along with tailored treatment suggestions.
